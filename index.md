# NeuroCognitive Imaging Lab (NCIL)

We are a resaerch laboratory housed in the Department of Psychology and Neuroscience at Dalhousie University in Halifax, NS, Canada. NCIL is devoted to improving quality of life through brain research. The ultimate goal of our research is to help people live healthier, happier, and more productive lives. We follow a cycle including basic research, active participation in clinical settings, clinical research, and knowledge translation and commercialization.

## Research
NCIL's research is focused on **Neuroplasticity**: how the brain is changed by experience. Neuroplasticity is an innate capacity of the brain. It includes changes that occur during development, learning (such as learning a new language), recovery from injury (such as a stroke), 
adaptation to the loss of a sense (such the loss of hearing or sight), and many other things.

In our lab, we mostly use **neuroimaging** tools like MRI and EEG to study the brain. These tools are non-invasive (they are safe and painless) and give us amazing abilities to see where and when things are happening in the brain. You can learn more about these tools under the Neuroimaging link at the top of the page.

Current research projects in the lab are focused on a number of different topics, including:
* Reading Development
* Second Language Learning
* Aphasia (an acquired language disorder)
* Brain-Computer Interfaces

You can learn more about our research projects under the Projects link at the top of the page.

## Do you want to participate in one of our studies?

We are often searching for volunteers to participate in our studies. Depending on what studies are acctive, we might be looking for elementary school children, young adults, older adults, people with different language learning experiences, or people with certain clinical conditions (such as stroke or vision problems). However, in order for our research to be done properly, each study has specific criteria for participation. If you are interested in participating, please click the link below.

## Our Resources
The NeuroCognitive Imaging lab makes extensive use of brain imaging technologies including:
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
Event-related brain potentials (ERP)
Magnetoencephalography (MEG)
As well, the lab has collaborations with other labs, individual researchers, and organizations to develop and complete innovative research objectives.
